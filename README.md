# Enhancing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)

The files `fourier_1d.ipynb` and `fourier_2d.ipynb` are the original implementation of
FNO for Burgers' Equation and Darcy Flow respectively.

## Burgers Equation

Models in the report can be found in:

- Original FNO: `proposal/burgers/v20/hfno-1d.ipynb`
- Proposed FNO: `proposal/burgers/v8/hfno-1d.ipynb`

## Darcy Flow

Models in the report can be found in:

- Original FNO: `fourier_2d.ipynb`
- Proposed FNO v1:  `proposal/darcy/v14/hfno-2d.ipynb`
- Proposed FNO v2: `proposal/darcy/v18/hfno-2d.ipynb`
- Proposed FNO v3: `proposal/darcy/v22/hfno-2d.ipynb`

## Datasets

1. Download `Burgers_R10.zip` for Burgers and `Darcy_421.zip` for Darcy Flow from [this Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UnbQh2WWc6knEHbLn-ZaXrKUZhp7pjt-){:target="_blank"}
2. Unzip the files
3. Create a directory `burgers` and `darcy421` in the root directory
4. Move the unzipped files to the respective directories
